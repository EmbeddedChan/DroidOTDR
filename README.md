# DroidOTDR
I just released version 2.0.0 of my free Android tool for viewing OTDR trace files.
It now supports:

📁 .sor and .msor formats (Telcordia SR-4731)

📄 PDF report export for sharing results

Improved UI and fixed several bugs in version 1.0

Mainly used for analyzing fiber optic networks on mobile.

**DroidOTDR** is an Android application developed for analyzing and visualizing OTDR (Optical Time Domain Reflectometer) trace data. It is currently under active development and available for early testing.

> 📱 Developed by **Chan**, a former hardware engineer now exploring Android development.
